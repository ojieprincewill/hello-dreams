        I've experienced failure countless times, often because I genuinely
        didn't know what I was doing wrong. I was putting in a lot of effort,
        but it was directed at the wrong things. After facing over 100
        rejections, I would pick myself up and continue with the same
        ineffective strategy. No matter how hard I worked, I was never going to
        see any success unless I paused and rethought my approach. Eventually, I
        had a swift change in mindsetâ€”I altered my strategy, began building my
        personal brand, and focused on learning new skills and acquiring
        knowledge. That's when I started to see even the slightest
        breakthroughs. No one really believed it could work out for me, except
        for my mum and siblings ðŸ˜…... But I tested the waters, discovered what
        works, and experienced massive changes. That's exactly what Hello Dreams
        is here to do for you. Change you story, help yoy build your personal
