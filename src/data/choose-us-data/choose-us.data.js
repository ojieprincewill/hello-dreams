I learned design principals of UI/UX and could practice using them in my own designs. As the training went on, my designs became more complex and I began using Figma more efficiently. I would rate it 10/10, the course was thorough and instructions were given when needed. There was also lots of support along the way.",

As a learner who knew only the basics, I was overwhelmed with joy for participating actively throughout this program because I have greatly improved. My friends, with whom we learned the basics together, once saw my design on LinkedIn and kept asking if I was actually the one who designed it, lol. I'm much more confident in myself now; the design freight is no longer there for me. I will be forever grateful to the sponsors and our amiable, patient, and ever-understanding tutor.",
