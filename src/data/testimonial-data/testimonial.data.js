    text: "Transafe Logistics LLC came to us after an extensive search for the perfect logo, having already tried over 15 designs from various designers, including those on Upwork, without finding the right fit. After a detailed discussion where we took the time to truly understand their goals and needs, we crafted a logo design that immediately resonated with them. Their satisfaction with our work led them to enroll 8 students in our UI/UX design training, recognizing the value we bring to the table. They also invested in our CV and LinkedIn optimization services, further solidifying our partnership. We're proud to have delivered what so many others couldn't, and we look forward to continuing to support Transafe Logistics in their journey.",
